I am a second year PhD student at the University of St. Andrews in the [analysis research group](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/). I am EPSRC funded, and supervised by [Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/) and [Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/). 

I am interested in fractal geometry, dimension theory, geometric measure theory and ergodic theory.
